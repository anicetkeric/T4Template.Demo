Generating Code Using Text Template Transformation Toolkit (T4)


Text templates are composed of the following parts:

  * Directives - elements that control how the template is processed.

  * Text blocks - content that is copied directly to the output.

  * Control blocks - program code that inserts variable values into the text, and controls conditional or repeated parts of the text.
